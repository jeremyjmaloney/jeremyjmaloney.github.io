# QUICKjoke App

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery

## App Creation Approach
* The application is intended for mobile users to read some quick jokes when they have a spot of free time.
* The app uses an api to asynchronously load 10 jokes at a time into a carousel which the user can read the joke, and click the answer button to reveal the answer.
* The user is also able to sift through all the jokes simply by clicking previous or next.
* If the user had read all the jokes they may click "Load More" to load 10 more jokes at random from the joke api.
* The app was created to be very user friendly and easy to understand. For this reason there is no need for instructions because the concept is immediately understood.
* The QUICKjoke application works best when viewed on mobile, but was made to be scalable depending on the size of the screen, while still maintaining the same look.
